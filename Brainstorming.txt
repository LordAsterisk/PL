When someone creates predicate male, what should happen?:

male = Predicate("male")    # This makes an object male(). Male is like a goal. It also creates two functions
maleAdd("Bob")              # This adds the fact that Bob is male.
maleAsk(X)                  # This queries for all males.

parent = Predicate("parent")
X = Var(X)
Y = Var(Y)
parent(X, Y).add(child(Y, X)))

-----------
Lists = [], [Var(A), Var(B), "Tail"]
